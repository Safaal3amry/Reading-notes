#Markdown
<p> Markdown is a method for designing text for the web. We control the width of the document; Formatting words in bold or italics, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just plain text that contains a few non-alphabet characters, such as (#)or(*).

 <p> It is very easy to work with as it allows you to write text and easily add tables, abbreviations and images.
          
   ~~All we have to do is add some icons before and after them as well as allow to control the font size~~
       
       
    <p> and some features such as:
    - For bold font ** **
    - For italics * 
    - and others
    - 
  <p> The symbols used are
: ()> <~~ # @
          
          
 #####I'll explain some of the commands:
  1. Headers use # their number controls font size
  2. For the quote  use >
  3. For ranked lists use 1.
