<p> Markdown is a method for designing text for the web. We control the width of the document; Formatting words in bold or italics, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just plain text that contains a few non-alphabet characters, such as # or *.
It is very easy to work with as it allows you to write text and easily add tables, abbreviations and images. All we have to do is add some icons before and after them as well as allow to control the font size and some features such as:
For bold font ** **
For italics * and others
The symbols used are
: ()> <~~ # @
          
          
 I'll explain some of the commands:
Headers use # their number controls font size
For the quote  use >
For ranked lists use 1.
